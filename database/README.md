# Membership Database

- Owner: sdkwork-membership platform team
- Capability: membership (commerce domain)
- Database role: `authoritative-server`
- Engine: PostgreSQL only
- Supported PostgreSQL: 15 or newer; no optional extensions are required
- Table prefix: `membership_`
- Compliance level: L2
- Contract version: 1.0.0
- Updated: 2026-07-30

## Related Specs

- `DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md` - lifecycle, directory layout, SPI, drift, seed locale
- `DATABASE_SPEC.md` - table/field/index semantics, pool rules
- `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` - migration governance
- `SUBJECT_ID_SPEC.md` - tenant isolation and subject scope rules
- `specs/commerce-order-membership-boundary.spec.json` - order/payment/membership ownership boundary

## Ownership Boundary

The membership database lifecycle initializes only membership-owned data needed by membership catalog, subscription reservation, entitlement fulfillment, points balance projection, privileges, rewards, and audit flows.

Order creation, token-plan purchase orders, membership-package purchase orders, payment execution, cashier, PSP webhook ingestion, payment settlement, recharge packages, and exchange rules are owned by `sdkwork-order` and `sdkwork-payment`. Those modules run their own database lifecycle and own their tables.

Membership is allowed to store the order identifiers required to reserve and fulfill a membership subscription:

- `membership_subscription.source_order_id`
- `membership_subscription.request_no`
- `membership_period.source_order_id`
- `membership_period.request_no`

Membership must not store payment intent, payment attempt, cashier, provider, or payment-method artifacts in membership-owned tables.

## Initialized Tables

The current baseline and contract initialize 18 membership capability tables.

| Table | Owner | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `membership_product_spu` | sdkwork-membership | Membership catalog SPU rows used by package SKU projection |
| `membership_product_sku` | sdkwork-membership | Membership package SKU rows and display metadata |
| `membership_plan` | sdkwork-membership | Membership plan/rank definitions |
| `membership_plan_version` | sdkwork-membership | Published plan versions |
| `membership_benefit_definition` | sdkwork-membership | Entitlement/privilege dictionary |
| `membership_plan_benefit` | sdkwork-membership | Plan-version benefit bindings |
| `membership_package_group` | sdkwork-membership | Billing-cycle package groups |
| `membership_package` | sdkwork-membership | Sellable membership packages |
| `membership_subscription` | sdkwork-membership | User subscription reservation and active-state record |
| `membership_period` | sdkwork-membership | Subscription period reservation and activation record |
| `membership_entitlement_account` | sdkwork-membership | Per-user entitlement balances and usage counters |
| `membership_entitlement_grant` | sdkwork-membership | Pending/active entitlement grants from membership fulfillment |
| `membership_entitlement_ledger_entry` | sdkwork-membership | Entitlement grant/use audit ledger |
| `membership_points_account` | sdkwork-membership | Membership points account projection |
| `membership_points_ledger` | sdkwork-membership | Membership points ledger projection |
| `membership_daily_reward` | sdkwork-membership | Daily check-in reward tracking |
| `membership_privilege_usage` | sdkwork-membership | Per-period privilege consumption summary |
| `membership_change_log` | sdkwork-membership | Immutable membership state-change audit log |

The baseline does not create and seeds do not insert any of these external tables:

- order-owned: `commerce_order`, `commerce_order_item`, `commerce_order_amount_breakdown`
- payment-owned: `commerce_payment_intent`, `commerce_payment_attempt`, `commerce_payment_method`, `commerce_payment_provider`, `commerce_payment_provider_account`, `commerce_payment_channel`, `commerce_payment_route_rule`
- order/payment adjacent commerce tables: `commerce_recharge_package`, `commerce_exchange_rule`

## Checkout And Fulfillment Data Flow

Membership persistence participates only after host-composed order checkout:

```text
product application composition root
  -> order-owned membership checkout service and UI
  -> sdkwork-order settlement
  -> membership fulfillment port activates subscription and entitlements
```

The membership database only persists the pending membership reservation and later activation state. It does not initialize order rows, payment rows, cashier configuration, PSP webhook rows, token-plan order rows, recharge packages, or exchange rules.

## Baseline And Seeds

- `database/ddl/baseline/postgres/0001_membership_baseline.sql`
- `database/seeds/common/001_catalog.sql` — token plan catalog (plans, benefits, packages, SKUs)
- `database/fixtures/002_dev_demo.sql` - explicit test/demo data; never read by production bootstrap

The baseline is the greenfield initialization snapshot for this pre-launch application. The migration directories are reserved for post-GA incremental changes and are intentionally empty unless a released schema needs expand/contract evolution.

The `standard` seed profile installs language-neutral catalog data plus the selected active locale.
Select it with `SDKWORK_DATABASE_SEED_PROFILE=standard`. Demo subjects and balances are test
fixtures and must be applied explicitly by a test harness, never by `db:seed` or application startup.

Seed data covers authenticated frontend membership flows for the demo tenant:

- tenant `100001`
- organization `0`
- user `1`
- 4 package groups: yearly, monthly, quarterly, one-time monthly
- 12 sellable packages: external ids `101`-`403`
- active demo subscription, period, entitlement accounts, grants, usage, daily reward, points account, and points ledger

Local checkout tests that need real order/payment rows must start the `sdkwork-order` and `sdkwork-payment` lifecycles separately. This repository must not add order/payment DDL or seed rows for convenience.

Automatic migration and seeding are disabled by default. Production changes run through an elected
migrator and reviewed release workflow; application replicas never race schema or seed execution.

## Contract Registry

- `contract/schema.yaml` - 18 table contracts registered with profile, compliance level, and owner
- `contract/table-registry.json` - machine-readable inventory of the 18 initialized tables
- `contract/prefix-registry.json` - `membership_` bounded-context prefix registration
- `database.manifest.json` - database module manifest used by `sdkwork-database`

Regenerate the contract from the PostgreSQL baseline after DDL changes:

```bash
pnpm run db:materialize:contract
```

## Initialization state

This module is in **initialization state** for greenfield deployments:

1. **Baseline** — `database/ddl/baseline/{engine}/0001_membership_baseline.sql` contains the full DDL snapshot.
2. **Migrations** — `database/migrations/{engine}/` is reserved for post-GA incremental schema changes only. It is intentionally empty at initialization.
3. **Drift** — run `pnpm db:drift:check` before release.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm run db:validate
pnpm run db:materialize:contract
pnpm run db:plan
pnpm run db:init
pnpm run db:migrate
pnpm run db:seed
pnpm run db:status
pnpm run db:drift:check
```
